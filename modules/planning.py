    Whereas the PyHopPlanner class below is optimized for use with MIDCA's built-in world
    simulator, this planner is more generalized. It assumes that the world state stored
    in MIDCA's memory is also the world state that will be expected by the planning
    methods and operators. Also, it expects to receive 'declare_methods' and
    'declare_operators' methods as arguments. These should initialize pyhop for the
    desired planning domain. The plan_validator arg should be a method which takes a
    world state and a plan as args and returns whether the plan should be used. This will
    only be called on old plans that are retrieved.
