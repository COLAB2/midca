Demo instructions:

Overview: This demo demonstrates the functioning of MIDCA version 1.02 in a simple blocksworld domain in which an arsonist sometimes sets fires. MIDCA uses statistically generated TF-Trees to insert goals to build towers of blocks, and, when fires occur, to put them out. In addition, MIDCA interfaces with Meta-AQUA to explain the possible reason behind the occurence of fires ( the arsonist), and generate a goal to catch him. The version without Meta-AQUA simulates this behavior.

*******

To run the MIDCA demo without Meta-AQUA:

1) from base directory, do python2.7 midca.py

2) at prompt, type "demo" and press return

3) press return to cycle through midca phases; skip n to skip n cycles.

4) ? or help followed by return will list the available commands.

Notes: The arsonist will become active at the fifth cycle. A goal to apprehend him will be generated when A-distance detects an anomaly. All goals to construct houses and put out fires are generated by TF-Trees. To view objective scores (e.g. houses constructed, etc.), simulate until the eval phase of any cycle.

*******

To run the MIDCA demo WITH Meta-AQUA:

1) log on to metacog or erewhon

2) start Meta-AQUA using /usr/local/allegrocommonlisp-8.2/alisp
	-note: this depends on initialization using a .clinit.cl file.

3) in another window, cd /fs/metacog/group/systems/MIDCA1.02

4) python2.7 midca.py

5) at prompt, type "demoMA" and press return

6) press return to cycle through midca phases; skip n to skip n cycles.

Notes: The arsonist will become active at the fifth cycle. A goal to apprehend him will be generated when A-distance detects an anomaly. All goals to construct houses and put out fires are generated by TF-Trees. To view objective scores (e.g. houses constructed, etc.), simulate until the eval phase of any cycle.
