### Cognitive Architectures and MIDCA
Speaker: Michael T. Cox

This talk presents an overview of the concept of a cognitive architecture. We provide two definitions from the literature and place the subject within the context of related terms such as cognitive system and cognitive agent. We briefly survey a small number of existing architectures and compare and contrast them to the Metacognitive Integrated Dual-Cycle Architecture or MIDCA.

### Using MIDCA to Enable Intelligent Rebellion
Speaker: James Boggs

This talk demonstrates how MIDCA can be used in unorthodox ways to create
rebellious autonomous agents and the benefits of using MIDCA for this
purpose. It discusses both the practical question of how MIDCA was used to
create rebel agents and higher-level  considerations about the nature of
MIDCA itself.

### MIDCA's Architectural Commitments
Speaker: Dustin Dannenhauer

This talk starts by asking the question: "What are MIDCA's Architectural Commitments"? One of
the core commitments is metacognition. I talk about work on metacognitive expectations, including some
early results, followed by some limitations and directions for future work.
