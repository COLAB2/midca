## Quickstart Guide

README for MIDCA, the Metacognitive Integrated Dual-Cycle Architecture.

1) Most code and documentation in this module is intended to be read with word wrap (<=80 chrs) enabled.

2) MIDCA is written for python 2.7; currently it will not run with other python versions.

3) To install MIDCA, run the setup.py file in this folder using python 2.7. Use the install option, so "python setup.py install" assuming 2.7 is your default python.

4) For a simple interactive version of MIDCA, run examples/cogsci_demo.py

5) To see how the MIDCA instantiation used in cogsci_demo.py is created and populated, see examples/cogsci_demo.py

6) For an overview of MIDCA and more details about how it works, see the github wiki (https://github.com/mclumd/MIDCA/wiki) and/or docs folder.

7) Questions and comments are welcome, please email wsri-midca-help@wright.edu
