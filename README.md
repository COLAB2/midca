# MIDCA: The Metacognitive Integrated Dual-Cycle Architecture.

1. MIDCA is written for python 2.7; currently it will not run with other python versions.

2. To install MIDCA, run the setup.py file in this folder using python 2.7. 

    ```
    python setup.py install
    ```
    
    If you will be making changes to MIDCA's code, use the `develop` option, like the following (assuming 2.7 is your default python).

     ```
    python setup.py develop
    ```

3. For a simple interactive version of MIDCA, run

    ```
    cd midca/
    python examples/cogsci_demo.py
    ```

4. To see how the MIDCA instantiation used in `cogsci_demo.py` is created and populated, see `examples/cogsci_demo.py`

5. For an overview of MIDCA and more details about how it works, see the github wiki
   (https://github.com/COLAB2/midca/wiki) and/or docs folder.
