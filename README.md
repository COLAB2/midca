README for MIDCA, the Metacognitive Integrated Dual-Cycle Architecture. Note that MIDCA currently only has one cycle; the meta- cycle has yet to be implemented.

1) Most code and documentation in this module is intended to be read with word wrap (<=80 chrs) enabled.

2) MIDCA is written for python 2.7; currently it will not run with other python versions. 

3) To install MIDCA, run the setup.py file in this folder using python 2.7. Use the install option, so "python setup.py install" assumign 2.7 is your default python.

4) For a simple interactive version of MIDCA, run examples/simple_run.py

5) To see how the MIDCA instantiation used in simple_run.py is created an populated, see the method userGoalsMidca() in examples/predicateworld.py. This method returns the MIDCA instance used in the example.

6) For an overview of MIDCA and more details about how it works, see the docs folder.
