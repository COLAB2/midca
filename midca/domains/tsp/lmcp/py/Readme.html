        <h1>Using the LMCP Python Code Package</h1>
        <h3 align=center>Created on Wednesday, February 24, 2021</h3>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <P ALIGN=LEFT>
            This document describes how to use Python classes generated for the
            Lightweight Message Construction Protocol (LMCP) system. The Python
            source code is produced using the LmcpGen utility, part of the
            LMCP package available from the AVTAS laboratory at AFRL.
        </P>

        <P ALIGN=LEFT>The LMCP Python source package includes classes to handle
            the creation, recognition, serialization, and de-serialization of
            LMCP objects.  The source package contains two top-level directories.
            The <code>lmcp</code> directory contains base classes from which all LMCP
            classes are derived.  These files enable interface-style access to
            LMCP objects regardless of the MDM namespace.  When implementing
            tools to handle LMCP classes, it is recommended that one uses these
            base-classes in methods.  The namespace directory contains
            classes that are specific to the MDM used when the code was
            generated.
        </P>

        <H2 ALIGN=LEFT>Creating LMCP Objects</H2>

        <P ALIGN=LEFT>Every LMCP struct listed in the MDM file has a
            corresponding class found in the namespace directory. Each class is
            listed in its own module (file).
            These classes are based on <I>LMCPObject</I> found in the lmcp
            directory. LMCP objects can be used in Python code in the same manner as
            any other Python class.  They are data containers, including access
            methods that allow programmers to use get and set fields.
        </P>

        <H2 ALIGN=LEFT>Serializing</H2>

        <P ALIGN=LEFT>LMCP-Python allows serialization of objects.
            Objects are serialized using the <code>pack()</code> method. calling
            <code>pack()</code> does not apply the necessary header or checksum for
            transmission, or unpacking.  The contruction of LMCP <I>messages</I> are
            described next.
        </P>

        <H2 ALIGN=LEFT>Creating LMCP Messages</H2>

        <P ALIGN=LEFT>An LMCP message is an LMCP object that is encapsulated
            with a header and a checksum.  In the Python package, use the method
            <I>packMessage()</I> in the <I>lmcp/LMCPFactory</I> module to create a message.
            This method takes a single <I>LMCPObject</I> as an input, as well as header items.  The object is set as the root object
            for the message.
        </P>

        <H2 ALIGN=LEFT>Unpacking Messages</H2>

        <P ALIGN=LEFT>Unpacking messages requires knowledge of the message
            root object type in order to instantiate the proper Python object type.
            The SeriesFactory class, located in <I>namespace</I> enables a
            user to convert bytes into LMCP messages and objects.  Using the
            <code>getObject()</code> method, the user can get the root object that is contained in a
            set of message bytes. The returned object is an <code>LMCPObject</code>
            type that can be used in the application.  Note that the stream-based
            getObjFromStream() method is blocking;  it will read until the
            number of bytes read from the header value is reached.
        </P>

        <H2 ALIGN=LEFT>Identifying Message Types</H2>

        <P ALIGN=LEFT>The python language keyword, <code>isinstance</code>, can be used for
            on any LMCP object to determine its type.  This is useful
            when creating handlers for messages that arrive through a data
            source.  Alternatively, <I>LMCPObject</I>s from the namespace
            package can be created using the <code>createObject()</code> method in the
            <I>SeriesFactory.</I>  This allows users to instantiate objects based on a
            type number.  Use the <I>SeriesFactory.</I> enumerations to relate series names and type
            numbers.
        </P>

        <H2 ALIGN=LEFT>A Note Regarding Types</H2>

        <P ALIGN=LEFT>LMCP defines unsigned types.  While this is common in
            many programming languages, python does not implement unsigned integers.
            The Python LMCP package handles this by using the next-largest type available in
            Java.  For instance, an unsigned byte is represented internally as an
            int in Python; an unsigned int is a long.  When unpacking these values,
            the unpack() methods bit-mask the Python value so that the proper value
            is passed to the LMCP byte buffer. Setting an unsigned field to a number
            less than zero or greater than the maximum value allowed by the
            unsigned type will result in an a &ldquo;wrapped&rdquo; value in the
            byte buffer.
