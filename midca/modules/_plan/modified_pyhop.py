Pyhop should work correctly in both Python 2.7 and Python 3.2.
For examples of how to use it, see the example files that come with Pyhop.

Pyhop provides the following classes and functions:

- foo = State('foo') tells Pyhop to create an empty state object named 'foo'.
  To put variables and values into it, you should do assignments such as
  foo.var1 = val1

- bar = Goal('bar') tells Pyhop to create an empty goal object named 'bar'.
  To put variables and values into it, you should do assignments such as
  bar.var1 = val1

- print_state(foo) will print the variables and values in the state foo.

- print_goal(foo) will print the variables and values in the goal foo.

- declare_operators(o1, o2, ..., ok) tells Pyhop that o1, o2, ..., ok
  are all of the planning operators; this supersedes any previous call
  to declare_operators.

- print_operators() will print out the list of available operators.

- declare_methods('foo', m1, m2, ..., mk) tells Pyhop that m1, m2, ..., mk
  are all of the methods for tasks having 'foo' as their taskname; this
  supersedes any previous call to declare_methods('foo', ...).

- print_methods() will print out a list of all declared methods.

- pyhop(state1,tasklist) tells Pyhop to find a plan for accomplishing tasklist
  (a list of tasks), starting from an initial state state1, using whatever
  methods and operators you declared previously.

- In the above call to pyhop, you can add an optional 3rd argument called
  'verbose' that tells pyhop how much debugging printout it should provide:
- if verbose = 0, then pyhop prints nothing;
- if verbose = 1, it prints the initial parameters and the answer;
- if verbose = 2, it also prints a message on each recursive call;
- if verbose = 3, it also prints info about what it's computing.
"""

# Like the SHOP and JSHOP planners (see http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/shop),
# Pyhop uses HTN methods to decompose tasks into smaller and smaller
# subtasks, until it finds tasks that correspond directly to actions.
# But several of the details are different:
# 
# (1) In SHOP and JSHOP, one uses a special-purpose language to write HTN
#     methods and planning operators -- but in Pyhop, one writes the methods
#     and operators as ordinary Python functions. This should make it easier
#     to use Pyhop as part of other programs. 
# 
# (2) Pyhop represents states as collections of variables, not collections
#     of logical assertions. For example, to say that box b is in room r1,
#     instead of writing an assertion such as "in(b,r1)", you would write
#     something like "loc[b] = r1".
# 
# (3) The current state is a Python object. The state variables are part of
#     that object, and you need to refer to this object explicitly in the
#     operator and method definitions. Thus, what you'd *really* write in
#     the above example is something like this:
#     s = State()
#     s.loc['b'] = 'r1'
# 
# (4) You also can define a goal as a Python object. For example, to specify
#     that your goal is to have box b in room r2, you might write this:
#     g = Goal()
#     g.loc['b'] = 'r2'
#     Pyhop doesn't explicitly check to see if the goal is achieved. But you
#     can pass the goal object as an argument to your operators and methods,
#     so that their preconditions and effects can refer to it. If you want to
#     accomplish a sequence of goals, one at a time (e.g., first achieve g1,
#     then g2, then g3), you could define all three of them as goal objects,
#     pass all three of them as arguments to your operators and methods.
# 
# (5) Unlike SHOP and JSHOP, Pyhop doesn't include a Horn-clause inference
#     engine for use in evaluating preconditions. So far, I haven't seen any
#     need for it; I've found it easier to write precondition-evaluation
#     functions directly in Python. But I'll consider adding Horn-clause
#     inference to Pyhop if someone convinces me that it's really necessary.
# 
# Accompanying this file is a file called examples.py that provides examples
# of how to use Pyhop. To run it, launch python and type 'import examples'.
